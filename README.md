Description:
Analytics and data science play a pivotal role in fraud detection and prevention activities. The work that one will be doing in the fraud analytics team is very similar to the work being done by the risk analytics professional.
However, as a fraud analytics professional, one will be also be required to detective work to uncover different modus operandi ( MOs) of the fraudsters and stay one step ahead of them. Basically the best fraud analytics professionals should be able to think like a fraudster/hacker themselves.
Regarding statistical techniques one should use both supervised and unsupervised techniques for fraud detection.
Supervised learning is generally used for looking into historical data and building a classification model that can be used for classifying future incidences into the “Fraudulent” vs “Non Fraudulent” classes.
On the other hand, unsupervised learning is used when MOs of fraudsters is evolving and we need to identify new patterns or anomaly detection (outliers).

Roles and Responsibilities:
• Understanding the data and preprocessing steps.
• Develop different Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms
• Compute Confusion Matrix and get “Precision" and "Recall" Chart
• Plot “Precision" and “Recall" Curves
• Develop different Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms
• Plot BOX and WHISKER plots

Machine Learning Algorithms:
Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms:
• Logistic Regression
• Decision Trees
Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms: 
• Exploratory data analysis
• BOX and WHISKER plot
• K-Means Clustering

Environment: R
